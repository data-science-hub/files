Message Text
------------

Dear {{reviewer}},

I am an editor of a new journal called Data Science, and I would like to ask you
whether you could help me by writing a review for the manuscript below within
the next 10 days?

Our journal has a number of unusual features to make reviewing more rewarding:
All submissions are available as open preprints, so you can share and discuss
the manuscript with whoever you like. We furthermore encourage you to make your
review non-anonymous, so you can share it on your blog or on social media, and
refer to it in your resume. We moreover aim to make acceptance decisions within
a few weeks, and accepted articles are all Open Access and their content can
therefore be freely accessed and reused.

Manuscript: {{authors}}. {{title}} ({{submission_type}}). {{url}}

You can use this link to accept or decline this review invitation:
{{orcid_url}}?mail={{reviewer_email}} (or simply reply to this email)

If you decide to accept, I would very much appreciate receiving your review
within 10 days, to allow for the mentioned fast response to authors.

Instructions for reviewers can be found at {{site_url}}/content/guidelines.

Thank you for your consideration.

With kind regards,

{{editor}}
