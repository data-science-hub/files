## Topic of the Special Issue

Distributed ledgers (DL) refer to a set of decentralised and distributed data
management technologies that are used to maintain data in form of a growing list
of connected records and keep track of transactions between different parties in
an efficient, verifiable, and persistent way. The Blockchain, the DL underlying
the bitcoin cryptocurrency, Ethereum, and Hyperledger are just some of the most
prominent platforms in this space. This special issue will offer researchers and
practitioners in data science the opportunity to present their work and ideas
around this set of technologies, across different domains and DL platforms. We
are seeking interdisciplinary contributions, as well as fundamental and applied
research on DLs. Submissions that focus on the use of ledgers in a particular
domain should discuss the positive and negative implications of using
decentralised technologies and, when relevant, compare them against existing
centralised solutions.

DLs are often praised for enabling more open, transparent and accountable
processes in finance and beyond. For example, in e-science, they could disrupt
scholarly publishing by allowing for a greater range of research outputs
(publications, software, data, designs, requirements etc.) to be brought
together into coherent, rich research objects, which could be identified,
discovered, and used more easily; and by making scientific processes and
contributions within a science team straightforward to trace and reward. They
could potentially help with managing digital rights for research assets (via
smart contracts), empower networks of researchers, and enable the technology of
the common as well. Many other applications exist, including e-government,
supply chain management, healthcare, and creative industries, to name just a
few. We encourage submissions in all these, as well as other domains. 

We welcome mature and ongoing work on algorithms, systems, experiments,
benchmarks, and analyses, as well as position statements and visions of
technology addressing, but not limited to, the following issues:

- Architectures and implementations 
- Consensus algorithms for distributed ledgers
- Smart contract languages and execution algorithms 
- Smart contract resilience and formal verification
- Proof-of-work, proof-of-stake and other proof mechanisms
- Scalability of distributed ledgers
- Interoperability of DL platforms, and between DLs and other data management
  systems
- Public and private ledgers 
- Algorithms and approaches to analyse DL data and transactions
- Digital rights management on the blockchain
- Distributed payment systems
- Applications of DLs to facilitate reproducibility, scientific data reuse, and
  self-publishing.
- Applications of DLs in other domains.

Submissions should comply with the guidelines for authors as outlined at
https://datasciencehub.net/content/guidelines-authors For submitting please go

## Important Dates

Submissions will be accepted from 1 October 2017 until 30 April 2018.

We will assign three reviewers for each submitted paper. Reviewers will have 10
days for a first review, we aim for a first decision within less that 30 days.
